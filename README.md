TrainerVR is a simulator which runs on the Oculus Quest allowing users to learn the basics of driving before they can be introduced to an actual vehicle. The user utilizes the Oculus Quest controllers for hand movements and the buttons for grabbing and pedal selection. Some features include:
* Scenarios and levels
* Realistic gear changes
* Multiple-choice quiz for basic knowledge and traffic signs
* Maintenance tasks
